### Minesweeper

Welcome to this tutorial on building your very own Minesweeper game using the LÖVE framework and Lua programming language. Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that challenges players to clear a grid of hidden mines using logic and deduction. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Minesweeper game and a deeper understanding of game development concepts.

In this step-by-step guide, we will cover everything from setting up your development environment to implementing game mechanics such as grid creation, bomb placement, and user interactions. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial will provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to create a fun and engaging game.

Let's dive in and start building our Minesweeper game!

### Minesweeper

Welcome to this tutorial on building your very own Minesweeper game using the LÖVE framework and Lua programming language. Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that challenges players to clear a grid of hidden mines using logic and deduction. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Minesweeper game and a deeper understanding of game development concepts.

In this step-by-step guide, we will cover everything from setting up your development environment to implementing game mechanics such as grid creation, bomb placement, and user interactions. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial will provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to create a fun and engaging game.

Let's dive in and start building our Minesweeper game!

#### Getting started
- LÖVE Framework
- your favorite text editor

#### Grid Creation

In this section, we will start by creating our Minesweeper grid. The grid is the main playing field where the game takes place. It consists of a matrix of cells, each of which can either contain a mine or be empty. We will use a two-dimensional array to represent this grid in our code.

Here is a step-by-step guide to creating the grid:

1. **Initialize the Grid**:
  First, we need to initialize the grid with empty cells. We will create a function to generate a grid of a specified size.

  ```lua
  function createGrid(rows, cols)
     local grid = {}
     for i = 1, rows do
        grid[i] = {}
        for j = 1, cols do
          grid[i][j] = { isMine = false, isRevealed = false, isFlagged = false, adjacentMines = 0 }
        end
     end
     return grid
  end
  ```
  Next we will create a function to draw the grid infomation into our canvas
  ```lua
  function update()
    -- draw grid
    for row = 1, MINE_ROWS do
      for col = 1, MINE_COLS do
        drawGrid(row, col) -- we will create a function to draw a grid on row,col
        drawMines(row, col) -- draw an exploded mine
        drawUnopenedBox(row, col) -- we will create a function to draw an unopened mine
        drawOpenedBox(row, col) -- show the number of mines on its surounding
        drawFlagged(row, col) -- if not opened an the user choose to flag the box as mine, we will display a little flag
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  ```lua
  
  to 
2. **Place Mines**:
  Next, we will randomly place mines in the grid. We will create a function to place a specified number of mines.

  ```lua
  function placeMines(grid, numMines)
     local rows = #grid
     local cols = #grid[1]
     local placedMines = 0

     while placedMines < numMines do
        local row = math.random(1, rows)
        local col = math.random(1, cols)
        if not grid[row][col].isMine then
          grid[row][col].isMine = true
          placedMines = placedMines + 1
        end
     end
  end
  ```

3. **Calculate Adjacent Mines**:
  After placing the mines, we need to calculate the number of adjacent mines for each cell. This information is crucial for the player to make informed decisions.

  ```lua
  function calculateAdjacentMines(grid)
     local rows = #grid
     local cols = #grid[1]

     for i = 1, rows do
        for j = 1, cols do
          if not grid[i][j].isMine then
             local count = 0
             for x = -1, 1 do
                for y = -1, 1 do
                  local ni = i + x
                  local nj = j + y
                  if ni > 0 and ni <= rows and nj > 0 and nj <= cols and grid[ni][nj].isMine then
                     count = count + 1
                  end
                end
             end
             grid[i][j].adjacentMines = count
          end
        end
     end
  end
  ```

4. **Putting It All Together**:
  Finally, we will create a function to initialize the entire grid, place the mines, and calculate the adjacent mines.

  ```lua
  function initializeGame(rows, cols, numMines)
     local grid = createGrid(rows, cols)
     placeMines(grid, numMines)
     calculateAdjacentMines(grid)
     return grid
  end
  ```

By following these steps, we have successfully created the grid for our Minesweeper game. In the next sections, we will implement the game mechanics such as revealing cells, placing flags, and handling win/loss conditions.
