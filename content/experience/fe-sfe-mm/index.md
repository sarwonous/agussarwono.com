As a Fullstack Engineer at Mataharimall.com, I played a key role in maintaining and enhancing their monolithic e-commerce application built with the PHP Phalcon Framework.  I collaborated closely with the backend team on the migration to a microservice architecture. This experience provided valuable full-stack development skills and fostered my ability to collaborate effectively within a large engineering team.  I then transitioned to specializing in Frontend Engineering.
Since then, I've become a seasoned Frontend Engineer with a proven track record of delivering high-quality e-commerce solutions. I have a strong history of collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to translate business requirements into innovative and user-friendly web experiences. My expertise includes responsive design, performance optimization, and modern web technologies.
